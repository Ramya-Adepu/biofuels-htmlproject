      <p class="style">Biofuels are a renewable energy source, made from organic matter or wastes, that can play a valuable role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
           Biofuels are one of the largest sources of renewable energy in use today. In the transport sector, they are blended with existing fuels such as gasoline and
           diesel. In the future, they can be particularly important to help decarbonise the aviation, marine and heavy-duty road transport sectors.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Biofuels:</h2>
    <p>Today, most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops and are called conventional biofuels. New technologies and processes that produce fuels from waste, 
       inedible crops or forestry products are being developed and these fuels are known as advanced, or second-generation biofuels. Advanced biofuels are likely to 
       become the primary form of biofuels in the future as they can improve their sustainability.</p>
