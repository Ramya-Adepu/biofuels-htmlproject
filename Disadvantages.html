           <title>DISADVANTAGES</title> 
           <h1 class="main">DISADVANTAGES OF BIOFUELS </h1>
           <p class ="firstpara">Biofuels were once touted as the saviors of the economy and the answers to our ever growing energy needs.
                As it turns out, they aren't quite the silver bullet they were claimed to be. Though biofuels have a number of advantages 
                over fossil fuels, their integration into the fuel supply chain has to be done with great care to ensure that their
             potential disadvantages are, if not eliminated,  minimized. At the current time, more "radical" alternative fuel technologies
             such as solar and wind have one major problem - portability.It is very difficult to transport large quantities of electricity 
             without using heavy, relatively inefficient batteries. Biofuels, on the other hand, are fairly easy to transport, have decent
             energy densities, and can be used with only minor modifications to existing technology and infrastructure. With that in mind, 
             it seems that biofuels will likely act as a stop gap or filler that helps us as we transition from fossil fuels to other
             technologies that aren't quite ready. We attempt to outline the disadvantages that should be considered when a biofuel is being 
             implemented, not to discourage their use, but rather to encourage responsible use of this technology, which is likely to become 
             our predominant source of energy as we transition over to cleaner alternatives in the more distant future. With that in mind,
             here are the disadvantages to be aware of.</p>
             <h2>Regional Sutability:</h2>
             <p class="para2"> 
             Despite pushes for Jatropha, Camelina, and algae, it is more likely that biofuel feedstock will be grown on a regional basis. 
             This is important for a number of reasons, chief among them being the fact that some crops just grow better in some locations
             and not so well in other. Things that will need to be taken into consideration are:
             </p>
             
             <div class="para2"><ol>
            <li><b>Water use</b> - The less water a crop uses, the better as water is a very limited resource. This is particularly important 
                in places that are more arid.</li> 
            <li><b>Invasiveness</b> - A crop that kills native plants and which is difficult to control is not a good choice as it may threaten
               biodiversity and severely damage the surrounding ecosystem.</li> 
              <li><b>Fertilizer</b> - Nutrients are needed for plants to grow. Some plants are more frugal with scarce resources than others.</li>
              <li><b>Limitations</b> - Some places just aren't going to be able to grow biofuel crops. Alaska, for instance, really isn't suited 
                to the rapid growth needed to produce crops year after year for fuel supplies. Regions like this will have to import fuels, so
                energy independence still will not be possible for every location.</li> 
             </ol>
             <h2>Food security</h2>
             <div class="para2">
                 <p>
             Biofuel feedstock has to be grown and there is only so much suitable land in the world for growing plants. Very little, for instance,
             is going to grow in the Sahara Desert. The problem with growing crops for fuel is that they take up land that could be used for growing 
             food. In a world with a population of around 7 billion and that is already short on food, there will necessarily be a tradeoff between
             food crop and biofuel feedstock. Every effort is made to grow feedstock that uses "none agricultural land." This means crops like corn
             and soybeans are out of the running.
