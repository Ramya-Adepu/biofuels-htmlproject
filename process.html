        <p>Biodiesel production is the process of producing the biofuel, biodiesel, through the chemical reactions of
         transesterification and esterification. This involves vegetable or animal fats and oils being reacted with 
         short-chain alcohols (typically methanol or ethanol). The alcohols used should be of low molecular weight.
          Ethanol is the most used because of its low cost, however, greater conversions into biodiesel can be reached 
          using methanol. Although the transesterification reaction can be catalyzed by either acids or bases, the 
          base-catalyzed reaction is more common. This path has lower reaction times and catalyst cost than those acid
           catalysis. However, alkaline catalysis has the disadvantage of high sensitivity to both water and free fatty 
           acids present in the oils.</p>

               Common feedstock used in biodiesel production includes yellow grease (recycled vegetable oil), "virgin" 
            vegetable oil, and tallow. Recycled oil is processed to  remove impurities from cooking, storage, and handling,
            such as dirt, charred food, and water. Virgin oils are refined, but not to a food-grade level. Degumming to 
            remove phospholipids and other plant matter is common, though refinement processes vary. Water is removed
            because its presence during base-catalyzed transesterification results in the saponification (hydrolysis) the 
            triglycerides, producing soap instead of biodiesel.
             A sample of the cleaned feedstock is then tested via titration against a standardized base solution, to determine
            the concentration of free fatty acids present in the vegetable oil sample.[citation needed] The acids are then
            either removed (typically through neutralization), or are esterified to produce biodiesel[citation needed]
            (or glycerides[citation needed]).</p>
            
           <h2> Reactions:</h2>
            Base-catalyzed transesterification reacts lipids (fats and oils) with alcohol (typically methanol or ethanol
            to produce biodiesel and an impure coproduct, glycerol. If the feedstock oil is used or has a high acid content, 
            acid-catalyzed esterification can be used to react fatty acids with alcohol to produce biodiesel. Other methods, 
            such as fixed-bed reactors,[3] supercritical reactors, and ultrasonic reactors, forgo or decrease the use of 
            chemical catalysts.</p></div>
            <h2> Product Purification: </h2>
            <p>
             Products of the reaction include not only biodiesel, but also byproducts, soap, glycerol, excess alcohol, 
             and trace amounts of water. All of these byproducts must be removed to meet the standards, but the order of
             removal is process-dependent.The density of glycerol is greater than that of biodiesel, and this property 
            difference is exploited to separate the bulk of the glycerol coproduct. Residual methanol is typically recovered by distillation and reused. Soaps can be removed or converted into acids. Residual water is also removed from the fuel.
