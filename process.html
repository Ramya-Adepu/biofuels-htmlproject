        <div class="head"><h1>PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS</h1></div>
       <div class="para" <p>Biodiesel production is the process of producing the biofuel, biodiesel, through the chemical reactions of
         transesterification and esterification. This involves vegetable or animal fats and oils being reacted with 
         short-chain alcohols (typically methanol or ethanol). The alcohols used should be of low molecular weight.
          Ethanol is the most used because of its low cost, however, greater conversions into biodiesel can be reached 
          using methanol. Although the transesterification reaction can be catalyzed by either acids or bases, the 
          base-catalyzed reaction is more common. This path has lower reaction times and catalyst cost than those acid
           catalysis. However, alkaline catalysis has the disadvantage of high sensitivity to both water and free fatty 
           acids present in the oils.</p>

               Common feedstock used in biodiesel production includes yellow grease (recycled vegetable oil), "virgin" 
            vegetable oil, and tallow. Recycled oil is processed to  remove impurities from cooking, storage, and handling,
            such as dirt, charred food, and water. Virgin oils are refined, but not to a food-grade level. Degumming to 
            remove phospholipids and other plant matter is common, though refinement processes vary. Water is removed
            because its presence during base-catalyzed transesterification results in the saponification (hydrolysis) the 
            triglycerides, producing soap instead of biodiesel.
             A sample of the cleaned feedstock is then tested via titration against a standardized base solution, to determine
            the concentration of free fatty acids present in the vegetable oil sample.[citation needed] The acids are then
            either removed (typically through neutralization), or are esterified to produce biodiesel[citation needed]
            (or glycerides[citation needed]).</p><hr>
            
           <h2> Reactions:</h2>
         <div class="para" ><p>Base-catalyzed transesterification reacts lipids (fats and oils) with alcohol (typically methanol or ethanol
            to produce biodiesel and an impure coproduct, glycerol. If the feedstock oil is used or has a high acid content, 
            acid-catalyzed esterification can be used to react fatty acids with alcohol to produce biodiesel. Other methods, 
            such as fixed-bed reactors, supercritical reactors, and ultrasonic reactors, forgo or decrease the use of 
            chemical catalysts.</p></div>
            <div class="para">Transesterification
                Animal and plant fats and oils are composed of triglycerides, which are esters formed by the reactions of three free fatty acids and the trihydric alcohol, glycerol. In the transesterification process, the added alcohol (commonly, methanol or ethanol) is deprotonated with a base to make it a stronger nucleophile. As can be seen, the reaction has no other inputs than the triglyceride and the alcohol. Under normal conditions, this reaction will proceed either exceedingly slowly or not at all, so heat, as well as catalysts (acid and/or base) are used to speed the reaction. It is important to note that the acid or base are not consumed by the transesterification reaction, thus they are not reactants, but catalysts. Common catalysts for transesterification include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium methoxide. Almost all biodiesel is produced from virgin vegetable oils using the base-catalyzed technique as it is the most economical process for treating virgin vegetable oils, requiring only low temperatures and pressures and producing over 98% conversion yield (provided the starting oil is low in moisture and free fatty acids). However, biodiesel produced from other sources or by other methods may require acid catalysis, which is much slower.[4] Since it is the predominant method for commercial-scale production, only the base-catalyzed transesterification process will be describe
                Triglycerides  are reacted with an alcohol such as ethanol  to give ethyl esters of fatty acids  and glycerol :

                The alcohol reacts with the fatty acids to form the mono-alkyl ester (biodiesel) and crude glycerol. The reaction between the biolipid (fat or oil) and the alcohol is a reversible reaction so excess alcohol must be added to ensure complete conversion.<p></p></div>
            <h2> Product Purification: </h2>
        <div class="para">    <p>
             Products of the reaction include not only biodiesel, but also byproducts, soap, glycerol, excess alcohol, 
             and trace amounts of water. All of these byproducts must be removed to meet the standards, but the order of
             removal is process-dependent.The density of glycerol is greater than that of biodiesel, and this property 
            difference is exploited to separate the bulk of the glycerol coproduct. Residual methanol is typically recovered by distillation and reused. Soaps can be removed or converted into acids. Residual water is also removed from the fuel.
