          <li> Real-Time Moisture Measurements at Key Points in the Process for Efficient Combustion and Rapid ROI

            <li>Biofuels are a key source of renewable energy and wood sourced products such as: 
            <ul><b>
           <li> Woodchips</li>
          <li>  Pellets</li>
           <li> Sawdust</li></b>
            </ul>
           <li>These products are<b> widely used to fuel powerstations and municipal heating systems.</b></li>
            
           <li> With an NDC Technologies instrument it is possible for operators to receive this biofuel moisture <br>
            content information in real time, enabling the operator to adjust the airflow to the furnace to <br>
            optimize combustion without having to wait for lab sample results.</li>
            
           <li>This results in more efficient combustion and a rapid return on investment.</li>

         <p aria-setsize="18px">      We start by using corn produced using sustainable farming methods that capture carbon and sequester it in
            the soil.   Other feedstocks are in our sights, but we examine the carbon intensity of their origins 
            carefully to make sure to optimize the LCA of the biofuel that will result, be it sustainable<b>aviation fuel,
            isooctane, isobutanol, renewable gasoline or renewable biodiesel</b>b.To further reduce our carbon intensity we
            have devised a program to use existing ethanol plants, converting them to our proprietary methods for creating
            isobutanol. We constantly research additional next-generation fuels, and explore untried feedstocks and
            new production methods. Independent, global, multi-stakeholder organizations, including the International
            Sustainability and Carbon Certification System and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, ensure 
            supply chains implement and uphold carbon and sustainability standards through review and certification.</p>

       <p><b>Plants use carbon dioxide to grow and produce food. This means that plants are able to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and thus decrease global warming. Biofuels, when produced from plants, can balance their CO2 production since they use carbon dioxide gas during growth. In The idea is that if there is a one-to-one short, since the gas produced is the same as the gas taken in, therefore, there is no net impact on global warming. Unfortunately, the entire problem lies in achieving that one-to-one ratio, which may be impossible.</b></p>
